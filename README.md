# Goodreads Widget for GitHub Profile

Allows me to pull my currently reading bookshelf off of my goodreads profile & using Github workflows, allows me to automatically update my profile readme with my most recent reads.

I made some minor formatting adjustment in this fork but if you're interested learing how to add your Goodreads bookshelf to your profile, definately go check out the original repo! It's well documented and makes integrating with Goodreads a breeze: [zwacky/goodreads-profile-workflow](https://github.com/zwacky/goodreads-profile-workflow)
